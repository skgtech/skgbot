# SKGTech Discord Bot

> Enables onboarding of new users, implements a help screen and various

    other functions.

# How To Install

We use Docker and docker-compose, so you will need to install
the [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] package
on your local machine.

Once that is done, enter the working directory and type:

```
docker-compose up
```

[More on all `docker-compose` available commands][docker-compose].

All targets require the following environment variables:

-   `POSTGRES_URL` A url with credentials pointing to the data store.
-   `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` The guild id of your server.
-   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` The Discord token of the bot.
-   `DISCORD_COMMANDO_UID` Your user id, so you can invoke discord commands.

-   `DISCORD_MODERATOR_ROLE_ID` The role id of the moderator role.
-   `SKGBOT_EMAIL_AUTH_PASSWORD` The SMTP password for sending emails.

This project also supports a [`.env` file][dotenv] which is on `.gitignore`
for your convenience when developing on your local.
