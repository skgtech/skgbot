# SKGTech Discord Bot

> Enables onboarding of new users, implements a help screen and various

    other functions.

# How To Install

We use Docker and docker-compose, so you will need to install
the [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] package
on your local machine.

Once that is done, enter the working directory and type:

```
docker-compose up
```

[More on all `docker-compose` available commands][docker-compose].

-   `POSTGRES_URL` A url with credentials pointing to the data store.

-   `DISCORD_COMMANDO_UID` Your user id, so you can invoke discord commands.
